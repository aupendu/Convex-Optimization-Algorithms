# Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) Algorithm in Wind Energy Conversion System

Different convex optimization algorithms to find the maximum value of the power coefficient of the wind power model
with respect to the tip-speed ratio.

### Algorithms
1. Gradient Descent Optimization
2. Conjugate Gradient Descent Optimization
3. Steepest Descent Method
4. Fusion of Conjugate Gradient and Steepest Descent (Conjugate gradient method is used to reach near optimum & steepest decent is used to settle at optimum.)
